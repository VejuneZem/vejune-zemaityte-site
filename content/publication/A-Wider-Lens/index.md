abstract: "A Wider Lens is the first comprehensive examination of the workforce, the work model, and the work culture, that constitute Australian film and television camera departments. The study pays particular attention to how social characteristics, such as gender, age, class, ethno-cultural identity, sexuality, disability, and caring responsibilities overlap and interact to shape career paths and work experiences in the film and television camera profession. In adopting an intersectional approach to understanding inequality as a defining feature of work in camera departments, the report seeks to add to the evidentiary knowledge base that informs both policy and practice in advancing a world-class, globally competitive, equitable, diverse, and inclusive screen industry in Australia. A failure to attend to key issues in labour market and workforce development risks the future potential of this knowledge-intensive, technologically innovative, and highly globalised sector to continue to add economic, social and cultural value to Australia."
