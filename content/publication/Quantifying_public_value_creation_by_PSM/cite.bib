	abstract = {In recent years a renewed interest has emerged in how public service media (PSM) generate public value, putting emphasis on how such value may express itself in multidimensional and non-linear ways. Yet, little has been achieved in systematically studying these ways and providing evidence to policymakers. In this paper, we propose that content diversity in TV programmes and the extent to which PSM collaborate with external partners could serve as quantifiable markers enabling the measurement of multidimensional public value creation. We also propose the utilization of a yet untapped resource for this purpose - data from broadcasters’ broadcast management systems (BMSs). Based on a comprehensive case study - Estonia’s public broadcaster ERR - we demonstrate a set of approaches to facilitate such analysis. These tools enabled us to show how a small PSM struggles with sustainable public value creation.},
