abstract: "In recent years, a renewed interest in how public service media (PSM) generate public value has emerged emphasizing how such value may express itself in multidimensional and nonlinear ways. However, little has been achieved in systematically studying these ways and providing evidence to policy makers. In this article, we propose that content diversity in TV programs and the extent to which PSM collaborates with external partners could serve as quantifiable markers that enable the measurement of multidimensional public value creation. We also propose the utilization of an untapped resource for this purpose—data from broadcast management systems. Based on a comprehensive case study—Estonia’s public broadcaster, ERR—we demonstrate a set of approaches to facilitate such analysis. This article suggests further ways for developing the approach with a longer-term goal of turning the multidimensional public value generation into an automated and systematic study in the service of policy interventions."
