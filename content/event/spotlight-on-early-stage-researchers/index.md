### Abstract

Dr Vejune Zemaityte from Tallinn University will introduce her research into gender diversity in screen media production which focuses on the relational labour structures that foster inequality. She will discuss the intricacies of working with large, industry-born datasets and the adoption of social network analysis methods for studying creative industries. The challenges and opportunities that arise when conducting industry-facing research in close collaboration with external partners will also be explored.
