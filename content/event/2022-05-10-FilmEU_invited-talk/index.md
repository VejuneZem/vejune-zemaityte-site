### Abstract

With ever-increasing amounts of data available about the global film industries, how do we as researchers select the important questions to pursue and the appropriate methodologies to adopt in order to answer them? In this talk, Vejune Zemaityte draws upon her experience of working as part of multidisciplinary research groups, as well as on industry-facing research collaborations, to discuss the nature of data-driven work concerning diversity and global cinema.
