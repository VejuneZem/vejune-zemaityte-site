## Objective

CRESCINEâ€™s overall objective is to enhance the competitiveness and cultural diversity of the European film industry. This will be achieved by understanding, engaging with, empowering, and ultimately transforming European small markets through original research and piloting the results in 7 countries. The countries within our specific scope are Estonia, Lithuania, Denmark, Ireland, Belgium (Flanders), Croatia, and Portugal.

## Work Programs

CRESCINE is organized into 8 WPs which feed each other in an iterative process having as a common denominator the focus on the challenges and affordances of six exemplary small European film ecosystems that represent seven small European countries. WP1 deals with project management and WP 2 with the overall project data pool. WP3 will provide the comparative analysis of the market, while WPs 5 to 7 will focus on dynamics across the value chain and users/viewers preferences. WP4 will identify and pilot innovative, scalable and sustainable business models while WP8 will exploit results from previous WPs and propose recommendations for further developments.
